                  <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser or device when you return, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
            <p>Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).Without a cookie, every time you open a new website, the server where that website is stored will treat you like a completely new visitor.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</p>

               <li>
                  <h4>Types of cookies and how we use them</h4>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons, including those detailed below. In most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this Site.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Targeting/advertising cookies</p>
            <p>Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you.

                  <h4>How you can control or opt out of cookies</h4>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our Site. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</p>
            <p>If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</p>
            <p>Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</p>
            <p>Except for essential cookies, all cookies will expire after a set period of time.</p>
            <p>Many browsers allow users to browse privately, whereby cookies are automatically erased after the user leaves the website. The following is a list of the most common browsers and the way in you can activate private browsing:</p>

               <li>Internet Explorer 8 and later versions: In Private</li>
               <li>Safari 2 and later versions: Private Navigation/Browsing</li>
