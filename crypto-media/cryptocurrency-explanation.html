A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>

                                 <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. “Crypto” refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>Cryptocurrencies can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">mined</a>&nbsp;or purchased from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/190-cryptocurrency-exchanges-so-how-choose/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>. Not all ecommerce sites allow purchases using cryptocurrencies. In fact, cryptocurrencies, even popular ones like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">Bitcoin</a>, are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/coinbase-ceo-says-adoption-bitcoin-retailers-will-take-quite-some-time/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">hardly used&nbsp;</a>for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoin-5179592" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5">retail transactions</a>. However, the skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies has made them popular as trading instruments. To a limited extent, they are also used for cross-border transfers.</p>

                                 <h3><span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text">Blockchain</span></h3>
                                 <p>Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain technology. As its name indicates, blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks or an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be verified by each node before being confirmed, making it almost impossible to forge transaction histories.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-8">1</span>&nbsp;The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, or computer maintaining a copy of the ledger.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, such as supply chain, and processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">JPM</a>) are testing the use of blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by streamlining payment processing.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-4">2</span></p>

                                 <h2><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Types of Cryptocurrency</span></h2>
                                 <p>Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency. An anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto invented it and introduced it to the world via a white paper in 2008. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies present in the market today.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>Each cryptocurrency claims to have a different function and specification. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Ethereum’s</a>&nbsp;ether markets itself as gas for the underlying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">smart contract</a>&nbsp;platform.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ripple-cryptocurrency.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">Ripple’s</a>&nbsp;XRP is used by banks to facilitate transfers between different geographies.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>Bitcoin, which was made available to the public in 2009, remains the most widely traded and covered cryptocurrency. As of May 2022, there were over 19 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $576 billion. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-11">3</span></p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>In the wake of Bitcoin’s success, many other cryptocurrencies, known as “altcoins,” have been launched. Some of these are clones or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">forks</a>&nbsp;of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch. They include Solana,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/litecoin.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">Litecoin</a>, Ethereum, Cardano, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-is-eos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">EOS</a>. By November 2021, the aggregate value of all the cryptocurrencies in existence had reached over $2.1 trillion—Bitcoin represented approximately 41% of that total value.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-3">4</span></p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <h2><span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text">Are Cryptocurrencies Legal?</span></h2>
                                 <p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Fiat currencies</a>&nbsp;derive their authority as mediums of transaction from the government or monetary authorities. For example, each dollar bill is backstopped by the Federal Reserve.</p>

                                 <p>But cryptocurrencies are not backed by any public or private entities. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn’t help matters that cryptocurrencies have largely functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. The legal status of cryptocurrencies has implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-action-task-force-fatf.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Financial Action Task Force</a>&nbsp;(FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-13">5</span></p>

                                 <p>Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <p>Some advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies are as follows.</p>
                                 <div>&nbsp;</div>
                                 <h3><span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text">Advantages</span></h3>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure, such as a large bank, setting off a cascade of crises around the world, such as the one that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">triggered in 2008</a>&nbsp;by the failure of institutions in the United States.</li>
                                    <li>Cryptocurrencies promise to make it easier to transfer funds directly between two parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/transfer.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">transfers</a>&nbsp;are secured by the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-key.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3">public keys</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4">private keys</a>&nbsp;and different forms of incentive systems, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5">proof of work</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6">proof of stake</a>.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-6">11</span></li>
                                    <li>Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties are faster as compared to standard money transfers. Flash loans in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7">decentralized finance</a>&nbsp;are a good example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without backing collateral, can be executed within seconds and are used in trading.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-18">12</span></li>
                                    <li>Cryptocurrency investments can generate profits. Cryptocurrency markets have skyrocketed in value over the past decade, at one point reaching almost $2 trillion. As of May 2022, Bitcoin was valued at more than $550 billion in crypto markets.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-16">13</span></li>
                                    <li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/remittance.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="8">remittance</a>&nbsp;economy is testing one of cryptocurrency’s most prominent use cases. Currently, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoins-best-use-isnt-currency-its-overseas-remittances/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="9">serve as intermediate currencies</a>&nbsp;to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders and, subsequently, converted to the destination fiat currency. This method streamlines the money transfer process and makes it cheaper.</li>

                                    <li>Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are actually pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can decipher. This opens up possibilities of governments or federal authorities tracking the financial transactions of ordinary citizens.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-19">14</span></li>
                                    <li>Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool with criminals for nefarious activities such as money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/ross-ulbricht-dark-net-pirate/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1">Dread Pirate Roberts</a>, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-20">15</span></li>
                                    <li>In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. In reality, ownership is highly concentrated. For example, an MIT study found that just 11,000 investors held roughly 45% of Bitcoin’s surging value.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-22">16</span></li>
                                    <li>One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes as much energy as entire countries consume. The expensive energy costs coupled with the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms whose revenues running into the billions of dollars. According to an MIT study, 10% of miners account for 90% of its mining capacity.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-22">16</span></li>
                                    <li>Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, other crypto repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in millions of dollars worth of “coins” stolen.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-15">17</span></li>
                                    <li>Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility. Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to as high as $17,738 in December 2017 before dropping to $7,575 in the following months.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-11">3</span>&nbsp;Some economists thus consider cryptocurrencies to be a short-lived fad or speculative&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bubble.asp" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2">bubble</a>.</li>
